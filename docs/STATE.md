# Project State (live)

**Read this first after any context compaction.** It is auto-printed by the `SessionStart` (compact) hook in `.claude/settings.json`. Update it at every milestone and before ending a session (rule in `CLAUDE.md`). Keep it short: facts that survive compaction, not narrative.

_Last updated: 2026-11-07 by core/backend session (N1+N2 merged; N3+N8 Neon Postgres + Render config on `be/neon-postgres`)_

## Where we are
- Phase: lanes open. Gate **G0 passed** (2026-11-06). Next gates: G1 first Hedera payment (needs owner keys), G2 firmware verify.
- Recommended first lanes (no keys needed): backend B1–B6 (`services/gateway`) and web W1–W3 (`apps/web`); firmware F1 if the ESP32 is in hand; web3 C1 is blocked on Hedera keys.
- Implemented: scaffolding + shared contracts only. No Hedera/0G/World keys exist yet; no lane code yet.

## Repo and PRs
- GitHub: https://github.com/ydvSajal/agentmeter (public, MIT). Default branch `main`.
- PRs #1 (docs), #2 (scaffold), #3 (shared contracts) are **merged into `main`** (merge commits, CI green). Lanes may now branch from `main`. Stacked-PR procedure for future work: `docs/WORKFLOW.md` §3.
- `packages/shared` now has: zod schemas, ports, fakes, `AgentMeterError` codes, `withTimeout`, receipt encode/sign/verify, typed gateway client, test vector `test-vectors/receipt.json` (public TEST key). 14 tests pass.
- Scripts: `node packages/shared/scripts/gen-keys.ts` (new signing seed + public key), `gen-vector.ts` (regenerate vector). Node ≥22.18 or 26 needed to run `.ts` scripts directly.
- Local: Windows, Node 26, pnpm 11. `reference/paybot` cloned (git-ignored).
- Git identity in repo config: Sajal. Commits end with the Co-Authored-By and Claude-Session trailer lines.

## Lanes (parallel sessions via worktrees, see `docs/WORKFLOW.md`)
| Lane | Status | Next task |
|---|---|---|
| core | K1–K4 done. N1 (#16 spec + AD034–036) and N2 (#17 `Notifier` port + `FakeNotifier`) **merged** | N4 Resend adapter, N5 orchestrator email hooks, firmware `WS_TLS` (needed for wss to Render) |
| web | not started | W1 scaffold Next.js after G0 |
| backend | B1-B6 merged into main (PRs #5-#9, #11); CI green. Smoke: real gateway + sim ESP32 + curl reached SETTLED on fakes. Fail-safe hardening PR open (`be/failsafe-fixes`, AD027-AD031): catch-all, settle-fail switches device off, step-up TTL, cap reservation, boot recovery | B7 agent CLI (needs C1 payer code), B8 scenarios; C-lane needs Hedera keys |
| web3 | C2 real facilitator adapter done (PR open); live-verified vs x402.org without keys | C1 first payment + C3 HCS need owner Hedera keys; C4/C5 need 0G key; C6 needs World client |
| firmware | owner has the ESP32 and writes firmware later; flasher tool in `tools/flasher` | F1 serial vector test when owner starts; protocol ref: `services/gateway/scripts/sim-device.ts` + `docs/API.md` §2-3 |

## Decisions in force
See `docs/DECISIONS.md` (AD001–AD036). AD034 Neon Postgres (replaces SQLite), AD035 Resend behind `Notifier`, AD036 gateway on Render (merged as proposed), AD037 dual Prisma provider (SQLite dev/tests, derived Postgres schema + migrations for Neon). Spec: `docs/SPEC-NEON-RESEND.md`; deploy runbook: `docs/DEPLOY.md`; `render.yaml` blueprint. Neon/Render/Resend keys not set yet; Postgres path unverified against a live Neon DB. Key ones: settle-on-ack; no Solidity; any 0G failure → SAFE_STOP; ports + fakes; layers L0–L3; gateway not serverless; flow never hangs (catch-all + boot recovery); settle fails 3× → device off, CANCELLED unpaid. Known demo risks accepted: WS token in query string, unauthenticated reads/callback (AD032-AD033).

## Blocked on the owner (ask, never invent)
- Hedera testnet accounts and keys: operator, payTo, agent (payer).
- 0G API key + credits (pc.0g.ai, booth); 0G Storage wallet.
- World portal client (auth.world.org/portal) and redirect URI.
- Hardware: ESP32, relay, low-voltage load.
- Submission deadline (reported Sun 8 Nov 09:00 IST, not on prizes page).

## Open technical questions
0G request ID on Router path · 0G Storage SDK package/API · Hedera SDK package (`@hashgraph/sdk` vs `@hiero-ledger/sdk`) · `@x402/hedera` on npm or monorepo source · x402 middleware verify/settle split · Ed25519 on ESP32 (`rweather/arduinolibs`).

## Gotchas learned
- pnpm 11 needs `allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (esbuild: true).
- Prizes page lists no deadline. Definitive and Chainlink resources are irrelevant to us.
- Paybot has no ESP32/receipt/policy/World/0G code; only the Hono resource-server shape and UX ideas are reusable.
- Two sessions share this repo: Session A (backend/web3/firmware/docs) and Session B (frontend `apps/web`). Session B should work in its own worktree (`.worktrees/web`); never commit another lane's files.
- `gh pr merge` by Claude is blocked by the auto-mode classifier; the owner merges PRs (bottom-up) or adds a permission rule.
- DB: Prisma 6 + SQLite. `pnpm --filter @agentmeter/db db:push` then `seed` (device d1, agent a1; dev token `dev-token-d1`, HMAC `dev-hmac-d1`). Relative `DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db` resolves next to `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Flasher: `pnpm --filter @agentmeter/flasher start` then http://localhost:5174 in Chrome/Edge. Flash PlatformIO .bin files and read serial output. Verified in-browser only (load, presets, no console errors); real flashing untested until the board is plugged in.
- DB tests/gateway tests use real SQLite; `createDb` uses one connection + long transaction limits (writes queue instead of SQLITE_BUSY). vitest in gateway runs files serially with 30s timeouts.
- x402 facts (verified 2026-11-06): `@x402/hedera`/`core`/`fetch`/`hono` 2.30.0 are on npm. Facilitators x402.org (fee payer 0.0.9185802) and Blocky402 (0.0.7162784) both list hedera:testnet. World OIDC discovery works (authorize/token/jwks under auth.world.org/api/v1). Run real-facilitator live tests with `LIVE=1 pnpm --filter @agentmeter/chain test`.
